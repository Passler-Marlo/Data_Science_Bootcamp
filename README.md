# Project Reflection: Eniac's Expansion into Brazil with Magist

## Summary
This project was a crash course in what it means to work with real-world data. The task was to evaluate whether Eniac should partner with Magist, a Brazilian SaaS company, to expand its eCommerce operations to Brazil. Using SQL and Tableau, my team and I dug into everything from delivery reliability to revenue development over location-based review charatersitics and average performances per product categories, aiming to figure out if Magist could handle Eniac’s high-end tech products. What started as a data analysis exercise quickly turned into a lesson in balancing between plotting the **relevant** data and making **ir**relevant data appear relevant! 

## Languages and Libraries Used
- **Languages**: SQL for slicing and dicing the data
- **Tools**: Tableau for trying (and trying again) to tell a clear visual story

## Key Learnings
- **Working with messy, real-life data is hard**: This was my first time analyzing actual data, and it hit me how much of a balancing act it is. There’s this constant tension between finding the "right" insight and not overworking the data to fit the story you want to tell.
- **Ethics matter more than I expected**: At one point, I was tempted to exclude outliers to make my charts look cleaner and more convincing. But then I realized: where do you draw the line? This taught me that integrity is just as important as the insights themselves.
- **Conveying insights is difficult**: Even when the analysis is spot-on, if you can’t convey your findings easily in a way that sticks in the head, the value gets diminished tremendously. Figuring out how to present my insights I found in the data so they make sense to the audience was not as easy as expected.

## Challenges Overcame
- **The frustration of "meh" visuals**: I spent hours in Tableau creating charts that didn’t feel good enough. Eventually, I had to focus (due to time-limits) on simplicity and clarity instead of obsessing over the perfect plot.
- **Facing the ambiguity of decision-making**: Should Eniac partner with Magist? The answer wasn’t crystal clear at all, and that ambiguity was unsettling. It taught me that decision-making often involves navigating shades of gray and making the best call with what you have.

## Additional Reflections
This project wasn’t just about SQL and Tableau—it was about learning how to think critically think with data, stay honest with the data, and communicate effectively. Data-driven decisions is messier than I hoped. But that is also exciting!! Lets move on.
